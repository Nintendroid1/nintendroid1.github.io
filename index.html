    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm a computer science student at Virginia Tech class of 2021 with my main interests in algorithms, systems, cryptography, and cybersecurity. I've always been in the market for interesting solutions and efficient implementations and the field of computer science provides this humble engineer with countless hours of joy, learning, and debugging (lots of it).</p>
      <p>As I continue onto full-time at the Department of Defense, I aspire to use my skills for the safety of others while working with complex systems and tools</p>
      <p>My main hobbies involve playing video games, performing music on my viola or ukulele, and listening to podcasts</p>
